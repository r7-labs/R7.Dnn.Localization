<h3>Version 8.0.4-12</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Mostly finished transition to Crowdin: https://crowdin.com/project/r7-labs-dnn-platform.</li>
  <li>Resolved DNN resource verification warnings about missing files (GH-17).</li>
  <li>Re-added translation for SecurityAnalyzer module.</li>
  <li>Overall, v12 is now should be much more closer to v10 (except of previously mentioned RadEditor/CKEditor).</li>
</ul>

<h3>Version 8.0.4-11</h3>
<p>Transition to Crowdin: https://crowdin.com/project/r7-labs-dnn-platform.</p>
<p>
  Note that v11 package contains slightly different set of resource files than v10 one -
  e.g. ones for RadEditor instead of DNN CKEditor. This is due to the fact that v11 takes the DNN Platform source code
  as a reference point (but not installed application, as v10 do).
